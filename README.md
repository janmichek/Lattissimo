Simple Latte including. Latte with no presenter. Simple demo of template inheritance.

I was missing this simple example, so i made one.
If you just need static html, but don't want duplicate headers, footers and menus or mess up with presenters - this is all you want.

Route keyword to template is a last parameter taken from url.
Simple create new template 'name.latte' and type domain.com/name to addressbar.
